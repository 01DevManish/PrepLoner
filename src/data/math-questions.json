    },
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "First, find the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0. So, (2-λ)(2-λ) - 0 = 0, which gives (2-λ)² = 0. The eigenvalues are λ=2, 2 (a repeated eigenvalue). The number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to an eigenvalue is given by the geometric multiplicity, which is n - rank(A - λI), where n is the matrix dimension. Here n=2, λ=2. A - 2I = [[0, 1], [0, 0]]. The rank of this matrix is 1. Therefore, the geometric multiplicity is 2 - 1 = 1. There is only 1 linearly independent eigenvector."

    "explanation": "To find the minimum value on a closed interval, we check the critical points and the endpoints. First, find the derivative: f'(x) = 2x - 1. Set it to zero: 2x - 1 = 0 => x = 1/2. This critical point is within the interval [0, 2]. Now, evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints: \nf(1/2) = (1/2)^2 - 1/2 + 1 = 1/4 - 1/2 + 1 = 3/4. \nf(0) = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1. \nf(2) = 2^2 - 2 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3. \nThe minimum value among {3/4, 1, 3} is 3/4."
