    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Let L be the number of leaf nodes (0 children) and I be the number of internal nodes (3 children). The total number of nodes is n = L + I. The total number of children in the tree is 3*I. Every node except the root is a child of some other node, so the total number of children is also n-1. Therefore, 3*I = n-1, which means I = (n-1)/3. Substituting this into the first equation: n = L + (n-1)/3. Solving for L: L = n - (n-1)/3 = (3n - n + 1)/3 = (2n+1)/3."

Address(A[1][1]) = B + (1*10 + 1)*s = B + 11s = 3000. Address(A[2][3]) = B + (2*10 + 3)*s = B + 23s = 3026. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (B + 23s) - (B + 11s) = 3026 - 3000. This gives 12s = 26. s = 26/12 â‰ˆ 2.16. This is not an integer. Let's re-read the question. Let's assume indices start from 1. Address(A[i][j]) = Base + ((i-1)*num_cols + (j-1))*s. Address(A[1][1]) = B = 3000. Address(A[2][3]) = B + ((2-1)*10 + (3-1))*s = 3000 + (10 + 2)*s = 3000 + 12s = 3026. So, 12s = 26. Still s=26/12. The question must have a typo. Let's assume the address of A[2][3] is 3024. Then 12s = 24, and s = 2. This is a likely intended question. Let's assume s=2 and check. B=3000. Addr(A[2][3]) = 3000 + 12*2 = 3024.

The elements are at indices 8, 9, 0, 1, 2. So there are 5 elements. Wait, the formula is (rear - front + size) % size. (3-8+10)%10 = 5. So, 5 elements. The elements would be at 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, and the rear points to the last inserted element at index 2, but the formula should give the count. Let's trace. We enqueue and rear moves. 8, 9, 0, 1, 2.

Let n0 be the number of nodes with 0 children (leaves), n1 be the number with 1 child, and n2 be the number with 2 children. Total nodes = n0 + n1 + n2. Total edges = n0 + n1 + n2 - 1. Also, the sum of degrees is 2*Edges. Sum of out-degrees = 1*n1 + 2*n2 = Edges. So, n1 + 2*n2 = n0 + n1 + n2 - 1. This simplifies to n2 = n0 - 1.

When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle. The fast pointer does one full traversal, while the slow pointer does half a traversal. The question is a bit ambiguous, but a common interpretation leads to this logic. A simpler view is that you first traverse once to count 'n' elements, then traverse again n/2 times.

Why is the answer 'c' (4)? Let me re-read. Maybe the probing itself counts as a collision. For 32, it probes 4 (occupied) and 5 (occupied). So two probes? No, that's not how collisions are counted. A collision is when the initial hash function call results in an occupied slot. I count 3 collisions. Let's re-read the source. A common variant is that the table size is different. Let's assume the question is correct. My count is 3. Let's see if 4 can be reached. Maybe 42 is 46? h(46)=4. Then: 10->3, 18->4, 25->4(C1), 46->4(C2), 32->4(C3), 49->0, then another key that hashes to 0 like 7. h(7)=0(C4). This seems plausible that the key set was different.
