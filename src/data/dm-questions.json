Using the associative law, this is (p ∨ ¬p) ∨ q. Since (p ∨ ¬p) is always true (Law of Excluded Middle), True ∨ q is always True. Therefore, it is a tautology."

However, this logic only holds for elements 'x' that are related to at least one other element 'y'. If an element 'x' is not related to any element in A (i.e., for that x, there is no y such that (x,y) ∈ R), then the premise of the proof is false, and we cannot conclude that (x,x) ∈ R.

We are looking for the coefficient of x^12 in the whole expression, which is equivalent to finding the coefficient of x^(12-9) = x^3 in the expansion of (1-x)^-3. The generalized binomial theorem states that the coefficient of x^k in (1-z)^-n is C(n+k-1, k). Here, n=3 and k=3. So, the coefficient is C(3+3-1, 3) = C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10. Let me re-check. Yes, 10. Why is the answer 'b' (15)? Let's re-read. Maybe the sum is different. Let's try another approach. We are looking for the number of integer solutions to a1+a2+a3 = 12, where a_i >= 3. Let a_i = b_i + 3. So (b1+3)+(b2+3)+(b3+3) = 12 => b1+b2+b3 = 3, where b_i >= 0. This is a stars and bars problem. The number of solutions is C(n+k-1, k-1) = C(3+3-1, 3-1) = C(5,2) = 10. I am consistently getting 10. Let me check the source. The question from GATE CS 2015 had a different expression. The question as stated here has the answer 10.

    "explanation": "A relation on a set A is a subset of A x A. There are n^2 possible pairs. For a relation to be symmetric, if (a,b) is in the relation, then (b,a) must also be in it. Let's consider the pairs. For the 'n' diagonal pairs (a,a), each can be either in or out (2 choices). For the n(n-1)/2 off-diagonal pairs {a,b}, we have three choices: include neither (a,b) nor (b,a), include both, or... wait. The logic is simpler. Consider the pairs (a,a) and {a,b} where a!=b. There are 'n' diagonal pairs and n(n-1)/2 off-diagonal pairs. For each diagonal pair (a,a), we can either include it or not (2 choices). For each off-diagonal pair {a,b}, we have a choice: either include both (a,b) and (b,a) or include neither. That's 2 choices. The total number of choices is 2^n (for diagonals) * 2^(n(n-1)/2) (for off-diagonals) = 2^(n + n(n-1)/2) = 2^((2n+n^2-n)/2) = 2^(n(n+1)/2)."

The new recurrence is S(m) = 2S(m/2) + 1. This can be solved by the Master Theorem. a=2, b=2, f(m)=1. m^(log_b a) = m^1 = m. Since f(m)=1 = O(m^(1-ε)), this is Case 1. The solution is S(m) = Θ(m).
