The condition for 100% efficiency in GBN is that the sender must be able to transmit the entire window (N frames) before the first ACK arrives. Time to send N frames = N * Tt = 10 * 40 = 400 ms. Round Trip Time (RTT) = 2 * Tp = 800 ms. Since the time to send the window (400ms) is less than the RTT (800ms), the sender's window will be exhausted.

Ah, the pattern is '11111' followed by a '0'. The receiver would remove this '0', resulting in the input string '011111101'. Let's re-examine the options. There seems to be an error in the question or options as provided in the source. Given the options, and the possibility of a typo where the output was meant to be different, let's assume the question is asking to identify the stuffed bit.

The provided output '0111110101' does contain five consecutive '1's followed by a '0', which implies a stuffed bit. This question from GATE CS 2001 is known to be ambiguous. Let's proceed with the standard interpretation: a '0' is stuffed after five '1's. The output 0111110101 has the sequence 111110. This 0 would be removed, yielding input 011111101.

    "explanation": "Transmission time (Tt) = Packet Size / Bandwidth = (1 KB * 1024 * 8 bits) / (100 * 10^6 bps) = 8192 / 10^8 s = 0.08192 ms. Propagation delay (Tp) = 2 ms. Efficiency (Utilization) = Tt / (Tt + 2*Tp) = 0.08192 / (0.08192 + 2 * 2) = 0.08192 / 4.08192 ≈ 0.02 or 2%. Let me recheck the calculation. Bandwidth is 100 * 10^6. Packet size is 1000 bytes, not 1KB. Let's use 1000 bytes. Tt = (1000 * 8) / (100 * 10^6) = 8000 / 10^8 = 0.08 ms. Efficiency = 0.08 / (0.08 + 2 * 2) = 0.08 / 4.08 ≈ 0.0196 or 1.96%. Let's assume 1KB is 1024 bytes. Tt = 8192 bits / 10^8 bps = 0.08192ms. Still very low. Let's check the propagation delay again, maybe it's RTT? No, it's one way. Let's assume the question intended a different value. Let's take a common GATE problem pattern where bandwidth is 1 Mbps. If B = 1Mbps, Tt = 8192 / 10^6 = 8.192ms. Efficiency = 8.192 / (8.192 + 4) = 8.192 / 12.192 ≈ 67%. The numbers in the question lead to a very low efficiency. Let's re-read the question and recalculate. Tt = (1024 * 8) / (100 * 10^6) = 0.08192 ms. Tp = 2 ms. Let's define 'a' = Tp/Tt = 2 / 0.08192 = 24.4. Efficiency = 1 / (1 + 2a) = 1 / (1 + 48.8) = 1/49.8 ≈ 2%. The provided options are likely based on different numbers. However, if we assume the question meant a 10 Mbps link: Tt = 0.8192 ms. a = 2 / 0.8192 = 2.44. Efficiency = 1 / (1 + 4.88) = 1/5.88 ≈ 17%. Closest to option B. If we assume a 1 Mbps link: Tt = 8.192 ms. a = 2 / 8.192 = 0.244. Efficiency = 1 / (1 + 0.488) = 1/1.488 ≈ 67%. Let's stick with the original numbers. There might be an error in the question or options. The calculated efficiency is ~2%. Let's pick the closest available option, which would be 'a'. This highlights how GATE questions can sometimes have issues.",

The protocol with the lowest AD is preferred. Typical default AD values are: OSPF (110), EIGRP (90 for internal), RIP (120), BGP (20 for external, 200 for internal). Among the given options, EIGRP has the lowest AD (90), but it's not an option. Between RIP (120) and OSPF (110), OSPF has the lower AD and would be chosen.

However, if we are forced to choose, my trace D[F]=13 (A-C-B-D-E-F) is the correct shortest path. Let's assume the question had a typo in B-C link and it was 3. Then D[B]=min(4, 2+3)=4. The trace would change. Let's assume the question intended to find the path A-B-D-F, which costs 15. The path A-C-E-F costs 15. The path A-C-D-F costs 16. The path my algorithm found costs 13.

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "In the classful addressing scheme, a Class A address uses the first 8 bits for the network ID and the remaining 24 bits for the host ID. The default subnet mask reflects this, with all network bits set to 1 and all host bits set to 0. This gives 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000, which is 255.0.0.0."

    "answer": "c",

    "options": { "a": "Physical and Data Link", "b": "Data Link and Network", "c": "Network and Transport", "d": "Physical and Network" },
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A standard Layer 2 switch primarily operates at the Data Link layer, using MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions. However, since it is a physical device with ports that receive and transmit electrical signals (bits), it also inherently operates at the Physical layer. So, it functions at both Layer 1 and Layer 2."

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The TCP window size specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be in transit (sent but not yet acknowledged). If the window size is 64 KB, this is 64 * 1024 = 65,536 bytes. Therefore, the sender can send up to 65,536 bytes before it must stop and wait for an acknowledgement."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "In IPv4, fragmentation can be performed by the original source host or by any intermediate router along the path if a packet is too large for the next link's MTU. However, reassembly of the fragments back into the original packet is only ever performed by the final destination host."

    "options": { "a": "Stop-and-Wait", "b": "Go-Back-N", "c": "Selective Repeat", "d": "All are equally efficient." },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A high bandwidth-delay product means the 'pipe' can hold many packets. Stop-and-Wait is very inefficient as it only sends one packet at a time. Go-Back-N is better but is inefficient if errors are frequent, as it retransmits many correct packets after a single error. Selective Repeat is the most efficient because it allows the receiver to accept and buffer out-of-order packets and only requests retransmission of the specific packets that were lost."
