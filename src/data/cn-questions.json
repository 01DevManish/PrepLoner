OK. \nP4 checks 4,5,6,7 -> 1,1,0,1 -> Sum of 1s is 3 (odd). Error. \nError is at position 1+4=5. Bit H5 is in error. Let me try again. \nReceived word: 1011011.

Error in P4. \nThe error is at bit position P1+P4 = 1+4 = 5. So bit 5 is in error. The answer is 'b'. Let me re-verify. Let's assume the question meant P1 checks 3,5,7. P2 checks 3,6,7. P4 checks 5,6,7. \n P1(H1) checks H3,H5,H7 -> 0,1,1 -> Sum=2 (even). OK. \n P2(H2) checks H3,H6,H7 -> 0,0,1 -> Sum=1 (odd). Error in P2. \n P4(H4) checks H5,H6,H7 -> 1,0,1 -> Sum=2 (even).

Let's stick with the standard method: Error at bit position = sum of incorrect parity bit positions. The error is at position 5. My first calculation was correct. Why is the answer 'c' (Bit 6)? Let's find a way to get 6. We would need P2 and P4 to be in error (2+4=6). P1 check: 1,3,5,7 -> 1,0,1,1 -> 3 (odd). Error. P2 check: 2,3,6,7 -> 1,0,0,1 -> 2 (even). Ok. P4 check: 4,5,6,7 -> 1,1,0,1 -> 3 (odd). Error. My calculation gives P1 and P4 in error -> bit 5. The question seems flawed."

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The sender sends 0,1,2,3. Frame 2 is lost. Receiver gets 0,1, sends ACK1, ACK2. Then it receives frame 3, discards it, and keeps sending ACK2. The sender, upon receiving ACK2, can send frame 4. It sends 0,1,2,3,4,5. It receives ACK1,ACK2. Its window is now [2,3,4,5]. It gets no further ACKs. Its timer for frame 2 expires. It will then go back and retransmit frame 2 and all subsequent frames it had sent. If it had sent up to frame 5, it retransmits 2,3,4,5. If it sent up to frame 8, it retransmits 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The number depends on how many frames were sent before the timer expired. Let's assume it sends the whole window before receiving any ACK. Sends 0,1,2,3. Frame 2 lost. Receiver gets 0,1. Then gets 3, discards it. Sender's timer for 2 expires. It retransmits 2, and 3. So 2 frames. The question is ambiguous. Let's re-read. 'After the sender's timer expires'. This implies the timer for the first un-acked packet (packet 2) expires. At this point, the sender's window might contain packets [2,3,4,5]. The Go-Back-N protocol dictates that the sender must retransmit the lost packet and all subsequent packets in its window. So it would retransmit frames 2, 3, 4, 5. So 4 frames.

    "explanation": "A Switch (Layer 2) creates a separate collision domain for each of its ports, meaning collisions are isolated to a single port. However, it forwards broadcast frames to all ports by default, so it forms a single broadcast domain. A Router (Layer 3) separates broadcast domains."

The time to transmit one bit is 1 / (10 * 10^6) seconds. So, the IFG is 96 * (1 / 10^7) seconds = 9.6 * 10^-6 seconds, or 9.6 microseconds."

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "To create a subnet for a point-to-point link, you need two host IP addresses, one for the interface of each router. To get 2 host addresses, you need at least 2 host bits (2^2 - 2 = 2). A /30 subnet mask provides 2 host bits. A /30 subnet consumes a block of 4 IP addresses: one for the network ID, one for the broadcast address, and two for the hosts."
